# Team Project (Group of Four - Space Invaders)


## Game Introduction and Project Plan:
The Gang of Four team bas implemented the famous Space Invadors game for this project. The game includes the traditional components: Aliens, Spaceship, Alien-Bombs. The game objective is for the player to destroy all the aliens before they either destroy the player or invade the player. The team will enhance the traditional game with new features to create a more exhilirating player experience.

As a starting point, source code was found, reviewed, and tested so that it may be used. The source code, implemented in java, provided a bare implementaion of only the component mechanincs and interaction. Those included, movement of player, shot from player to destroy alien, alien movement, alien dropping bombs. This limited implementation served as the perfect base to expand on. The team implemented features to provide the player with three lives, created feature for leveling up the player shot to destroy multiple aliens, a scoreboard to display the player score, a timer to display the time it took to beat the game, buttons to restart, pause, toggle music, and cheat-codes to increase the player's abilities.

## Planning 
* The first stage team estimates the stories and creates a development plan broken down into iterations needed to cover the required functionality part after part. 
* If one or more of the stories can’t be estimated, so-called spikes can be introduced which means that further research is needed.

## Designing 
* A part of the planning process, but can be set apart to emphasize its importance. 
* It’s related to one of the main XP values that we’ll discuss below — simplicity. 
* A good design brings logic and structure to the system and allows to avoid unnecessary complexities and redundancies.

## Coding 
* This phase during which the actual code is created by implementing specific XP practices such as coding standards, pair programming, continuous integration, and collective code ownership.

## Testing
* A core of extreme programming. 
* It is the regular activity that involves both unit tests.

## Listening 
* It's all about constant communication and feedback between members.
* Project managers are involved to describe the business logic and value that is expected.
