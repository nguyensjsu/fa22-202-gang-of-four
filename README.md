# Team Project (Group of Four - Space Invaders)


## Game Introduction and Project Plan:
The Gang of Four team has implemented a new iteration of the famous Space Invadors game for this project. The game includes the traditional components: Aliens, Spaceship, Alien-Bombs and additional features implemented by our team for this new version. The team will enhance the traditional game with new features to create a more exhilirating player experience. The game objective is for the player to destroy all the aliens before they either destroy the player or invade the player in the fastest time.

<br>
As a starting point, source code was found, reviewed, and tested so that it may be used. The source code, implemented in java, provided a bare implementaion of only the component mechanincs and interaction. Those included, movement of player, shot from player to destroy alien, alien movement, alien dropping bombs. This limited implementation served as the perfect base to expand on, especially because the implementation was already fairly loosely coupled. The refactoring step was not too tedious to create the best base to expand on and build features. The team implemented features to provide the player with three lives, created feature for leveling up the player shot to destroy multiple aliens, a scoreboard to display the player score, a timer to display the time it took to beat the game, buttons to restart, pause, toggle music, and cheat-codes to increase the player's abilities. As the code base increased, the code was organised into packages based on the design and feature being implemented. By doing so, it was easier to troubleshoot and merge contributions from other teammates.

The Gang of Four team functioned as an agile team and completed the project in a four week sprint period. The team followed and maintained the core XP values when developing the game, created a Kanban board to track the tasks and progess, took part in daily scrum meetings (either virutal or in person), and worked together to complete blockers, plan and design features, and maintain a realistic and value adding sprint backlog. Each team memeber maintained a weekly journal to document what was completed, what is planned to be completed, any blockers, and how the team is staying true to the XP core values to work as an effective team.
