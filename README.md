We followed tthe process and roles of extreme programming. XP framework normally involves 5 phases or stages of the development process that iterate continuously:

## Planning 
* The first stage team estimates the stories and creates a development plan broken down into iterations needed to cover the required functionality part after part. 
* If one or more of the stories can’t be estimated, so-called spikes can be introduced which means that further research is needed.

## Designing 
* A part of the planning process, but can be set apart to emphasize its importance. 
* It’s related to one of the main XP values that we’ll discuss below — simplicity. 
* A good design brings logic and structure to the system and allows to avoid unnecessary complexities and redundancies.

## Coding 
* This phase during which the actual code is created by implementing specific XP practices such as coding standards, pair programming, continuous integration, and collective code ownership.

## Testing
* A core of extreme programming. 
* It is the regular activity that involves both unit tests.

## Listening 
* It's all about constant communication and feedback between members.
* Project managers are involved to describe the business logic and value that is expected.
