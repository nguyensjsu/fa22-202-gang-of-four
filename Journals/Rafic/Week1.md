# Week 1 Journal
<b>Team member: Rafic Roy Hasbini</b>
<br>
<b>What have I been working on?</b>
<br>
For this week the initial tasks to start up the project included deciding on an idea. Our team decided to find source code for a space invaders game and agree on the features to implement.
After finding an appropriate code base to expand, we then began talks on how we may refactor our code so that it is loosely coupled and provides a clean base to implement features.
I took on the task to refactor the code in a way which allowed us to expand it using desing patterns. I then committed the source to github so that the team may look it over, get and idea, and start to contribute.
The team also had a meeting to discuss what features are to be included in this sprint, as well as how they will be implemented. 
This week also included administrative tasks to create the Task board and set up the directory for journals. I Have also began to implement the decorator pattern for leveling up the player shot.

<b>What I plan to do today/this week?</b>
<br>
For next week, I plan to complete implementing the player shot using the decorator pattern, and document the approach in the project readme file by including notes and diagrams.
I also plan on coming up with more features which may be implemented and support the team in the features that they would like to implement. This will include taking part in code reviews.
We have started talks as a team to refactor the base code more and expand on the functionality of the game to include a start page, pause buttons and grow the functionality of the game over page.

<b>What are my blockers?</b>
<br>
For this week, I do not have any blockers. 
However I have introduced a blocker for other members with a broken commit that I have made to main. So I will be prioritizing that fix before expaning/completing any other features.

<b>Core XP value - (Communication)</b>
<br>
The team has kept communication values in multiple ways. We began a whats app group chat so that we may communicate frequently on tasks for the project and support each other.
The team has also met twice this week to go over the code base, as well as discuss the features to implement and delegate that work.
We have also began to use the task board as a way to keep the team informed on progress of each task.
