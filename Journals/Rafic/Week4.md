<b>What have I been working on?</b>
<br>
For this week the timer observer pattern has been completed. I have also completed testing of the game. I took part in team meetings to discuss what needed to be completed, as well as troubleshoot certain bugs and come up with approaches. I also completed the documentation of the game, contributed to demo ideas, and took part in the 1 min Ad video creation.

I plan to present our project with my team.

<b>What are my blockers?</b>

<b>Core XP value - Simplicity</b>
<br>
We maintained the XP core value of simplicity as we wrap up the project by making sure we complete only the tasks outlined by the project description. We kept this list provided to us by the professor as a manifest for what we have left, and as the definition of "done".
