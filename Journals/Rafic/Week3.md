# Week 3 Journal
<b>Team member: Rafic Roy Hasbini</b>
<br>
<b>What have I been working on?</b>
<br>
This week I have focused on a handful of tasks. The shot level up feature using decorator pattern has been merged and tested for bugs during gameplay. Bug relating to levelup player and shot icons has been fixed. I also fixed a new bug relating to indexing when aliens get shot. I have also started working on the implementation for timer observer. The tasks from this week also included approving pull requests from other team mates by testing their features. Some bugs were caught in relation to music file and image file paths when merging to main branch.

<b>What I plan to do today/this week?</b>
<br>
For this week, I plan to complete Timer observer implementation. I also plan on contributing to testing the overall gameplay once the project has been completed to ensure all features have been completed successfully. For this final week, I also plan to contribute to writing the project report and drawing UML diagrams for the feature design patterns I have implemented. A demo for the project will also be created to be presented to the class. Finally journals will be looked over and finalized for the project.

<b>What are my blockers?</b>
<br>
For this week, I faced one blocker relating to running code due to path errors. I have addressed these errors to the team so that they may be fixed as well. Once these blockers are fixed, I will be able to run the code and complete my integration testing tasks.

<b>Core XP value - Simplicity</b>
<br>
The team practiced the core XP value of simplicity by remaining to use the kanban board and completing the tasks that have been agreed on. Since the board contains tasks that are blocking the project and tasks that mainly add value, simplicity was maintained to complete what needs to be done.
