# Week 2 Journal
<b>Team member: Rafic Roy Hasbini</b>
<br>
<b>What have I been working on?</b>
<br>
This week I have completed the level up decorator for the shot. The player is now able to shoot an icon and level up the shot. Both the player icon and the shot image changes. I have also had meetings with my team so that we coordinate on what features need to be completed. We also chatted about a method for Peer review of code before code is merged to the main branch. We also contributed to setting up the Kanban board so that tasks may be tracked. One feature we discuessed for next week implentation is to introduce a timer to track how fast the player completes the game, and how we may implement that.

<b>What I plan to do today/this week?</b>
<br>
This week I will fix my journal 1 entry's core XP value since there was a lack of communication bewteen both myself and my teammate on who is owning which XP core value. I also plan on fixing the level up decorator bug related to the size of the new player and shot icon after leveling up. I also plan on begining work on the timer observer to see how long the game takes the player to beat. We will continue to have meetings through out the week as a team.

<b>What are my blockers?</b>
<br>
For this week, I do not have any blockers. I will continue to work through and complete my tasks.

<b>Core XP value - Simplicity</b>
<br>
The XP core value of simplicity was honored this week as each team mate has started to make their commit for the features they have. Simplicity can be seen by the fact that the features implemented are all what we agreed on. To further adhere to simplicity, the new implementation of the Kanban board allows for the team to complete the agreed upon tasks and stay focused.
