# Week 2 Journal
<b>Team member: Rafic Roy Hasbini</b>
<br>
<b>What have I been working on?</b>
<br>
This week I have completed the level up decorator for the shot. The player is now able to shoot an icon and level up the shot. Both the player icon and the shot image changes. I have also had meetings with my team so that we coordinate on what features need to be completed. We also chatted about a method for Peer review of code before code is merged to the main branch. We also contributed to setting up the Kanban board so that tasks may be tracked. One feature we discuessed for next week implentation is to introduce home screen and game over screen with buttons, and how we may implement that.

<b>What I plan to do today/this week?</b>
<br>
This week I will fix my journal 1 entry's core XP value since there was a lack of communication bewteen both myself and my teammate on who is owning which XP core value. I also plan on fixing the level up decorator bug related to the size of the new player and shot icon after leveling up. I also plan on begining work on the screens for home, gameplay, and gameover/victory. We will continue to have meetings through out the week as a team.

<b>What are my blockers?</b>
<br>
For this week, I do not have any blockers. I will continue to work through and complete my tasks.
