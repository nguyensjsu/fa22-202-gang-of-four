# Week 1 Journal


Team Member: Sankalp Tiwari


What have I been working on?

For the Week 1 Sprint, the team first met and agreed to brainstorm project ideas that we will be working on. We all first researched various projects and games and mutually agreed to select the “Space Invaders” game for implementing the project. We discussed the feasibility of implementing the game in java and went through various videos of Space Invaders to get a better idea of the game concepts. The next task was to find a code base that we will be using for the project implementation. We found and agreed upon an open-source Space Invaders game. The next task was to analyze and get familiar with the working of the code and think of features that can be added to the project. The team was continuously communicating and sharing different insights for project development.


What do I plan to do today/this week?

For this week, I have planned to run the entire code to get a better understanding of the code base and its various attributes. I will also be referring to the website of the source code to understand different components of the code and their working. After getting comfortable with the implementation of the original code, I plan to refactor the code while ensuring it still follows OOP and SOLID design principles. I am planning to add a few missing functionalities in the game like the scoreboard and if time permits, I will also try to implement a background music that will run throughout the gameflow. 


What are my blockers?

There are no blockers for me right now. 


Core XP value - Communication

Our team is quite well in communication, since day one we have been communicating with each other on a daily basis through different media channels like WhatsApp, Voice Calls and Google Meet. This has been really beneficial as we were able to understand different aspects of the project quite easily and were able to share any potential problems that we might face later. Every member of the team has a previous work experience and this has helped us in ways like we were able to setup quick and efficient meetings and were able to decide on the next plan of action.
