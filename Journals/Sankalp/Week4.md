# Week 4 Journal


Team Member: Sankalp Tiwari


What have I been working on?

For the final week of the sprint, I have been working to design and implement the logic for the Restart Button feature, this feature will restart the game after clicking a button on the screen. I have implemented this feature using command pattern. For implementing this feature, I added JButtons on the gameplay screen and added buttons to incorporate the logic. In addition, I also thought of an idea to make a feature that will change the Background music of the game by clicking a button. To implement this feature, I used the code for strategy pattern that I created in the Week 3 of the Sprint. I also added logics to pause the game, resume the game, pause the current music, play the music after pause. Due to time constraints, I was not able to implement design patterns in the previous 4 features. To incorporate these buttons on the JPanel, I had to increase the width and height of the gamescreen and reposition the observer component(Live Score). Harshit and Rafiq changed thier implementations to handle the same. While doing the PR, Zaber found a bug in my restart component and he fixed it by impementing another design pattern on top of my command pattern. While reviewing the code, I thought of a way to implement the Live Score observer in a more optimised way and hence had to update the the code of the observer components. Apart from this, I also performed refactoring of the code base and reviewed the code of my peers.


What do I plan to do today/this week?

As this is the last sprint, there isn't any planned work to do. However, testing will continue to insure a stable build for demo. If there are any bugs detected, they will be addressed.

What are my blockers?

There are no blockers for me right now. 


Core XP value - Communication

We had the quickest and responsive communication in this week as all the implementations were being made and there were some merge conflicts that needed to be addressed. We have a common chat group which was used for communication, this helped us in resolving the issues very quickly. We were able to give feedback and approve the changes using this for some places where we didn't feel the need to commit to github and create a PR. We also did a Retrospective and discussed about the things that went well and the things that didn't. We also discussed the things that we learnt during this group project. During this project, we learnt the importance of communication in project development, as there were times when we were stuck at some place and by communicating with the team, we were able to resolve the issue quickly.
