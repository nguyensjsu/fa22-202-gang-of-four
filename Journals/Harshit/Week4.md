<b>What have I been working on? </b>
<br>
This week I have been working on refactoring the code and completing the documentation. Everyone has more and less completed their code implementations, therefore the team needs to work and make the code clean. I realized that the screen was not big enough to accommodate all the features therefore I made the changes to expand the screen, this resulted in changes in position of the features being disturbed, I streamlined the implementationa dn changed the code such that the code is no longer impacted if the screen size is changed anytime in the future.

<b>What do I plan to do this week? </b>
<br>
I plan to complete the demo of the project in class and update the project and documentation if there are any feedbacks from the professor.

<b>What are my blockers? </b>
<br>
No Blockers.


<b>Core XP Value- Feedback </b>
<br>
My core XP value for the week is feedback, I try to take and give feedback with the team.
I try to take feedbacks on my part of the project from the team. And give honest feedback on the code and doubts to the others.
