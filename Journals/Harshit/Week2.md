<b>What have I been working on? </b>
<br>
This week I focused on implementing the multiple lives feature. 
The game currently only has a simple functionality where the game ends when the player is hit by a single bomb.
To make the game enjoyable, I decided to add multiple lives to the player.
Even when the player get hit, he can continue playing until he exhausts his lives.
The number of lives provided to the player was decided to be 3 which is a standard practice for many games.
To implement the multiple lives scenario and display it I decided to use observer pattern.

<b>What do I plan to do this week? </b>
<br>
I plan to add another functionality for the third week. I haven't decided the functionality yet and that would be part of the weeks action items.


<b>What are my blockers? </b>
<br>
I faced hardware issues with my system which delayed my commit for the second week.


<b>Core XP Value- Feedback </b>
<br>
My core XP value for the week is feedback, I try to take and give feedback with the team.
I try to take feedbacks on my part of the project from the team. And give honest feedback on the code and doubts to the others.
