<b>What have I been working on? </b>
<br>
This week I focused on implementing the difficulty level feature. 
The game currently only has a simple functionality where there is just a single difficulty level.
To make the game more challenging, I decided to introduce a higher difficulty level. 
On the higher difficulty the player shots can no longer be seen and the player will try to hit the aliens by estimating the speed of shots.
It is the game equivalent of removing the tracer shots from your gun.
To implement the difficulty level feature I decided to use state pattern.

<b>What do I plan to do this week? </b>
<br>
I plan to refactor the code and complete the documentation.


<b>What are my blockers? </b>
<br>
I faced hardware issues with my system which delayed my commit for the third week.


<b>Core XP Value- Feedback </b>
<br>
My core XP value for the week is feedback, I try to take and give feedback with the team.
I try to take feedbacks on my part of the project from the team. And give honest feedback on the code and doubts to the others.
