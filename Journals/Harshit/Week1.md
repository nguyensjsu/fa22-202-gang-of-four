# Week 1 Journal

<b>Team Member: Harshit Chouksey</b>
<br>
<b>What have I been working on?</b>
This week being the inception of the project the first half of the week was dedicated to research different possible games which could have been the topic of our project. 
We all shared our findings and opinions and with mututal concensus decided on "Space Invaders". (My visit to CHM for the quiz, happened to bring me to the space invader exhibit at CHM; which gave me additional ispiration to work on this project.
We took the code base and spent time to understand the functionality; in addition we explored what features can be added to the project and what patterns can be used while implementing them.
We had the discussion about the same and gave each other feedback about the choices. Additionally, we discussed the process flow of the project.

<br>
<b>What do I plan to do this week?</b>
This week I plan to implement the first functionality i.e. the multilives functionality, the cureent code base just supports the player to play a single life.
The documentation will be added for the same.
If time permits I will work with the team to help othes add one functionality by each team member to the project.

<br>
<b>What are my blockers ? </b>
I currently don't have any blockers.

<br>
<b>Core XP Value- Simplicity </b>
We have tried to keep the entire process simple, the functionalities we will be implementing in a way that they won't create bloackers for other developers.
The code deployement will try to have similar feature.
